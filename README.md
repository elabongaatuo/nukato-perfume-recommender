Key in your perfume in the 'Find Your Perfume' page and you'll get a list of suggestions to try.It may not be perfume shazam, but it's a great place to start!

Would you like to know how a recommender system works?No worries, I go over a simple one and explain how this project works [here](https://medium.com/@elabongaatuo/building-a-content-based-perfume-recommender-system-using-python-18da91b53f6b)

# Introduction
Frustrating, is what I would describe the process of looking for a new perfume when you just can't find your favorite one in stock. Perfumes have a science to them, layers upon layers to build a scent that is unique to you. In this project, I scraped a couple of websites for perfume details to create my dataset (perfume.csv). I then made a function that offers recommendations based on cosine similarity. And for interaction, I deployed it to a website. The important links are above. :)


# Project Flow
* Create a recommendation function using cosine similarity
* Use FASTAPI to make web-app
* Build Interactive Website

# Technologies Used
1. Python 3.7 
2. Javascript 
3. Bootstrap CSS 5.2.3 (Installed via CDN)
4. FASTAPI 

# Installation and Usage
